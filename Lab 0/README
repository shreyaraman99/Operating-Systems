DESCRIPTION OF FILES:

lab0.c:
This is a C source file that accepts the arguments:
     --input=filename...use the specified file as standard input
     --output=filename...create the specified input file
     --segfault...force segmentation fault
     --catch...register SIGSEGV handler that catches the segfault
     --dump-core...dump core on segfaults

Makefile:
This supports:
     default...builds lab0 executable
     check...runs smoke-tests
     clean...deletes files created by Makefile
     dist...builds tarball

breakpoint.png:
Screenshot that shows that the pointer is null.



SMOKE-TEST CASES:

I checked whether the program was successful in copying one file to another, whether there was an incorrect argument, whether there was input failure, whether there was output failure, and whether --segfault, --catch, and --dump-core gave the correct output. These smoke-test cases are found in the Makefile.
